  "statement": "You are given an integer n. Your task is to print all binary numbers of exactly n bits in increasing order. Leading zeroes must be included so that every number is of length n. The binary numbers must be printed in sorted order based on their numerical value.",
  "input_format": "The first and only line contains a single integer n - the number of bits.",
  "output_format": "Print 2^n lines. Each line should contain a binary number of exactly n bits, in increasing numerical (sorted) order, starting from 0.",

    "1 <= n <= 20": true
